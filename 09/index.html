            The University of Calicut is the largest University in Kerala.
            Established in the year 1968, it is the second university to be set
            up in Kerala. The University aim to nurture excellence in education
            and research in its catchment areas of Northern Kerala, historically
            consigned to the periphery of Kerala's academic map. The University
            lays its emphasis on fostering quality human resource and promoting
            productive research that benefit both local communities and wider
            humanity.<br />

            The Univer sity was created through a Government planbifurcating
            Kerala University. As per the plan, the four postgraduate
            departments of the University of Kerala operating in Calicut were
            annexed to the new University along with fifty four constituent
            colleges spread across seven northern districts. With Nirmaya
            Karmana Sree as it motto, the University has been a ble to surmount
            all challenges and emerge as the largest residential cum affiliating
            University in Kerala. With 30 post graduate departments and 426
            colleges it has become a beacon of hope and enlightenment for
            hundreds of thousands of young men and women in North Kerala.
